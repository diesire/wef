About Wef
=========

Wef is a Web Extensions Framework

*   License: [MIT License](https://github.com/diesire/wef/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
*   Tests: [test/](https://github.com/diesire/wef/tree/master/test)

Features
--------
*   Educational purposes: Because I'm learning JavaScript and `Hello, world! is mainstream.
*   Work in progress: You know, forever beta stage.
*   Eating your own dog food: Wef is used in my awesome
    [CSS Template Layout Module](https://github.com/diesire/cssTemplateLayout).
*   Plain JavaScript, no third party libraries: OK, Wef uses [JSCSSP](http://glazman.org/JSCSSP/), but no jQuery or
    other libraries.
*   Modular and extensible with plugins
